# Time to appreciate cowboys
Have you ever thought to yourself: "darn, i really wish somebody here would appreciate cowboys without things getting all weird and sexual"?

If you answered yes to that question then this website is the website for you! Welcome to cowboy appreciation! A website devoted to the nonsexual appreciation of cowboys! Yeehaw!

## Casting call...
The website is currently looking for a mascot. We need someone to represent cowboy-kind in a non-sexual way. Their duties include but are not limited to:
- Posing as a cowboy while wearing a turtleneck
- Making promotional videos discussing what it means to be a cowboy (to avoid sending the wrong message, these videos will be shot in a church)
- Public outreach campaigns to help cowboys remember to stay hydrated (the Wild West is a desert and dehydration is a serious issue)
- Goodwill towards man
If you feel up for the challange, and you are capable of meeting the above requirments, please submit your audiiton in the 'casting' page of the website.

## Visit the actual website
Okay, without further ado, here is the website (the image[^1] below is a link):
