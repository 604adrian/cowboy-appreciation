        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Here at <em>Cowboy Appreciation</em>, we have been working to realize a world where people can appreciate cowboys without making things weird.</p>
        <br>
       <p>Unforunately, this is not an easy task. Because, though there is much to appreciate in cowboys, the general public has done its best to prevert this innate sense of adoration and turned it into something creepy, weird, and (worst of all) sexual.<p>

 <p>There are many issues with this. For one thing, it is arguably Satanic. And it makes many people blush and squirm in their seats (and for good reason, too). People with such reactions may choose to avoid appreciating cowboys in the future, in order to escape this muggy feeling.
        </p>
        <br>     
        <p>This is unforunate, because here at Cowboy Appreciation, we believe that the ability to appreciate cowboys is a human right, so no one's access to the appreciation of cowboys should be unjustly hindered by the moral corruption of their fellow citizens.</p>
      <p>That is why Cowboy Appreciation is taking concrete steps to fight back agains the oversexualization of cowboys. These concrete steps include but are not limited to our ongoing campaign to infultrate the popular media.
